spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2://mem:db;DB_CLOSE_DELAY= -1 #The value -1 indicates that the database should not be closed when the last connection is closed. This allows you to access the data even after all connections are closed, which can be useful for testing scenarios or in applications where you want to persist data beyond the lifespan of a single connection.
